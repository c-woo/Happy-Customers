The survival rate of males in class 1 is a little more than double the survival rate of males in classes 2-3 at 37%. Females in classes 1 and 2 had a 90+% chance of survival while females in class 3 had a 50% chance of survival. It's clear by looking at this data that most of the survivors were female and we should make sure to take this into account when making our models."

Passengers that have 2-4 members are more likely to survive while the survival rate starts to dip considerably for passengers with families of 5 or more. There are many reasons why this may be the case; solo passengers may not have known the ship was sinking until it was too late. People with family members could have been alerted earlier with more members being aware of what's happening around the ship. People with large families could have had a hard time gathering all the members of their family. These reasons are all just speculation on my part, but we can see that family size does have an impact on the survival rate of a passenger."
